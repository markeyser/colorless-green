# Welcome to Colorless Green

**A collection of expert playbooks on building reliable, specialized, and grounded AI systems.**

Colorless Green is dedicated to the science and engineering of applied AI. The playbooks and articles here explore a central thesis: that the path to robust, high-performance AI lies not in the brute force of massive, generalist models, but in the precision and efficiency of smaller, open-source models that are expertly fine-tuned to the data and the task at hand.

The content focuses on a rigorous, three-phase methodology for model specialization:

1. **Domain Adaptation** (e.g., DAPT/CPT)
2. **Task Specialization** (e.g., SFT)
3. **Behavioral Alignment** (e.g., RLFT)

This is a resource for practitioners dedicated to building AI that is not only powerful, but also auditable, efficient, and deeply aligned with real-world, domain-specific challenges.

## Available Playbooks

- **[From Zero-Shot to Expert: A Deep Dive into Retrieval Domain Adaptation](01-retrieval-course/00-01-index.md)**

  *A graduate-level playbook on building and fine-tuning state-of-the-art retrieval systems. This guide covers the journey from foundational theory and modern architectures (BM25, SPLADE, ColBERT) to the advanced DAPT → SFT workflow for creating high-performance domain experts.*

- **[Training the Agent: A Deep Dive into Policy Optimization with RLFT](02-agentic-reasoning-course/index.md)** - *Coming Soon*

  *An advanced playbook on moving beyond prompt engineering to train autonomous AI agents. This guide details the CPT → SFT → RLFT stack, using methods like GRPO to teach smaller language models how to behave: when to retrieve, which tools to use, and when to stop or abstain.*
